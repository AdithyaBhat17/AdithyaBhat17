## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adithya, a 22-year-old Full-Stack Designer from Bengaluru, India.  

I'm a React nanodegree graduate and an IDF certified UX Designer. Free time is hard to come by, but I freelance and craft web apps for a living when it does.  

#### Background 

I studied computer science and engineering at RNS Institute of Technology, Bangalore. During my time at RNSIT, I volunteered as a graphic designer with a small team that helped me jump start and hone my digital designer skills.  

Besides design, I also build web apps using React, Node, and many more tools. I'm currently working at [Betsol](https://betsol.com) as a Web Architect on a product called Leto. I'm involved in the design (both UI/UX and architecture) and the product development using React, Redux, Node, and Postgres.

I'm Adithya, a 23-year-old UX Engineer from Bengaluru, India.  

I'm a React nanodegree graduate and an IDF certified UX Designer. Free time is hard to come by, but I freelance and craft web apps for a living when it does.  

#### Background 

I studied computer science and engineering at RNS Institute of Technology, Bangalore. During my time at RNSIT, I volunteered as a graphic designer with a small team that helped me jump-start and hone my digital designer skills.   

I'm currently working on the [Culture+â„¢](https://www.culture-plus.com/) product suite at [Softway](https://www.softway.com/) as a UX Engineer. Besides design, I also build web apps using React, Node, and many more tools.
